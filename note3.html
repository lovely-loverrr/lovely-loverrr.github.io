        <h2>Note 3</h2>
        <p>Words can explain how happy with a mix of kaba, it was the moment I will always remember since it will be first act and letting u know about my intentions. I am so happy that we can bond alone although it's not that great but it's enough for our current situation. We only talked about one topic yet it was very enjoyable to me, well at that moment I was really into you it was very hard containing myself. I wanted to stare at your eyes longer but I get shy, I wanted to hold your hand longer but I haven't broke that physical barrier yet. I wanted to say that you're really beautiful but I was too scared but later on I did it anyway, you looked so cute HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. I hope u liked the gift I got you, I wanted to give you flowers but at the time I didn't know what you wanted then I saw a bouquet made like a plushie and I instantly bought it hehe. Yung long drive, harsh weather and many more obstacles was so worth it if I get to see you. Otw home ask whi, I was screaming on the top of my lungs, to release my happiness I'm so glad you gave me chance to pursue you. That's all for now</p>
